# Cryptography application

A basic quiz application where quiz questions are concealed within images using steganography techniques. Upon user login, they receive an X509 certificate, which grants them access to the quiz and can be utilized three times before it becomes invalid and is added to the Certificate Revocation List (CRL). Additionally, quiz results are encrypted using an envelope encryption method to ensure security and confidentiality.
